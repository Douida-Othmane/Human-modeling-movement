The identification of human activity represents an asset to be known in various fields such as biometrics, remote patient health monitoring, and many others. For this, motion or inertial sensors such as the gyroscope and the accelerometer found in smart watches and smartphones can measure characteristics such as the angular velocity of movements in the human body and use them to learn models capable of identifying the movement of the human. Recently, deep learning offers popular models to achieve human activity recognition using representation learning techniques that automatically generate optimal features from raw input data generated from sensors without the need for human intervention and identify hidden patterns in the data. This work is based on the development of a deep neural network model, called CNN ( Conv2D in Tensorflow ) and LSTM ( ConvLSTM2D in Tensorflow ), These models produced a significant accuracy after all the pre-processing procedure of the WISDM data, which gave a great approach for the recognition of human activity.
